          <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
          <p>
            Hi, I'm Dharshini Subanu S, a passionate developer with a deep interest in technology and its transformative power. My journey in the tech world has been fueled by curiosity and a desire to create meaningful web applications that enhance user experience.

          <p>
            I thrive on challenges and love to push the boundaries of what is possible through code. Every project is an opportunity for me to learn and grow, whether it's mastering a new technology or refining my design approach. My recent projects have involved creating responsive websites and exploring modern frameworks, which have further fueled my enthusiasm for front-end development.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of programming, I enjoy exploring new ideas and perspectives, often through reading and engaging in creative hobbies. Whether I'm experimenting in the kitchen with new recipes or hiking in nature, I find inspiration everywhere. I believe that taking breaks and indulging in different activities enhances my creativity and problem-solving skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also have a keen interest in community-driven initiatives. Volunteering for tech workshops and mentoring aspiring developers has allowed me to give back to the community and share my knowledge. I believe that learning is a continuous journey, and I am always eager to learn from others as much as I share.
          </p>
          <p>
            My goal is to contribute to impactful projects that make a difference in peopleâ€™s lives. I believe in the power of collaboration and community. Working alongside like-minded individuals to bring innovative solutions to life excites me. I'm always open to new opportunities and experiences that challenge my thinking and expand my skill set.
